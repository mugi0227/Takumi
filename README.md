# Takumi - Artisan's Skill Inheritance System

[![Hugging Face Spaces](https://img.shields.io/badge/%F0%9F%A4%97%20Hugging%20Face-Spaces-blue)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mugi007/takumi)

This system features Google's AI, Gemma 3n, acting as an expert "interviewer" to transform the un-manualizable "tacit knowledge" of skilled technicians into "explicit knowledge" that can be passed on to the next generation.

## ‚ú® Core Features

This application is built on a unique **2-Phase Analysis Approach** to maximize the capabilities of Gemma 3n.

1.  **Phase 1: Auditory Analysis**
    * The AI first focuses solely on the audio from a work video. It transcribes not only speech but also critical environmental sounds (e.g., machine hums, tool clicks), creating a rich, timestamped auditory log.

2.  **Phase 2: Integrated Analysis & Dialogue**
    * The AI then analyzes the auditory log and video frames together. Instead of just summarizing, it acts as an **expert interviewer**, creating a draft manual (IKO Format) and generating insightful questions to probe the expert's tacit knowledge where information is missing.

3.  **Human-in-the-Loop**
    * The expert answers the AI's questions, and this new information is integrated to create a complete, high-quality technical manual.
